At the same time, look for a camera that provides a cloud storage strategy.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad.

This implies that choosing which camera is best for you might depend on how conspicuous you desire it to be and what it will tape-record. </p>
