The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the destructive enemy to tape these codes and utilize numerous breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
