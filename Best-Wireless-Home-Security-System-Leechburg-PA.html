<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same method as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is seeing you'?

The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the same person might put a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
