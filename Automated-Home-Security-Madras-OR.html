<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

Alexa support is consisted of, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly deals with all the usual functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
