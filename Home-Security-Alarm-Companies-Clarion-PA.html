For instance, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensing units can be changed or a system that can be set up in such a way that your large family pets won't cause incorrect alarms to be sent every time your family pet moves. If you have big pets, you might wish to consider avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensing units which aren't activated by motion but are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make sure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
