<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
