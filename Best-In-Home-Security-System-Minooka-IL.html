<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
