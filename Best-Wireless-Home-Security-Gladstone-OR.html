This action coupled with an electric current (generally at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to find a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are extremely common and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can normally be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
