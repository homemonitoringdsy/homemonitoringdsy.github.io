<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies.

Consumer purchase all their equipment upfront and can sign up for month-to-month monitoring for $10-15.

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
