<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
