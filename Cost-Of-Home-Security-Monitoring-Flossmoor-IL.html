<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensors. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This means that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your property is larger than 4,500 square feet.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
