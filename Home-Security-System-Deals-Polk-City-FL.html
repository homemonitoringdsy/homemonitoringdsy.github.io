Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
