<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see a lot of growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience differs commonly depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
