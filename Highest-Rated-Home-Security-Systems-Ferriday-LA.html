Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Think about whether you  wish to automate your lighting, your garage door, and your entry system if you haven't yet started out uprating your home.
