<p>Models: There are a number of various types of security cameras out there. A few of the more common ones are bullet cameras, which are the rectangular boxes you may see protruding from a wall; dome cameras, which are frequently attached to a ceiling and housed in a tinted cover; and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, which use remote-control abilities to adjust the field of view.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller sized than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most excellent response time of all home security companies we reviewed. Their timeframe for response in under 10 seconds, which we should confess is rather amazing.
