<p>The other major decision when choosing a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will frequently be developed to be more durable and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp. The downside of outdoor cameras is that they're typically mains powered and require expert installation. Fortunately, I've tested out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I've learned into the list below.
