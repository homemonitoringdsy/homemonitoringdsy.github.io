<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
