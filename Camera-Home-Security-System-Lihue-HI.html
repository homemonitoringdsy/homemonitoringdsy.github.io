<p>ADT does not have the strongest client service track record amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this up to the fact that ADT has several million more customers than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations. There's a great deal of speak about wireless cameras, but that term can be complicated.
