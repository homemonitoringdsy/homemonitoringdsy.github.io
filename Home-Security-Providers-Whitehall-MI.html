We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
