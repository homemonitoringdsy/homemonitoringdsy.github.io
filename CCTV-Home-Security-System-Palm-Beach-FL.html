When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
