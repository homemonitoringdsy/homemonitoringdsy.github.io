The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

If there are three choose emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can only see one. This develops a one in three chance of catching a specific occurrence on video (either live or recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for filing event reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database by means of the computer system network.</p>
