<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was found. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
