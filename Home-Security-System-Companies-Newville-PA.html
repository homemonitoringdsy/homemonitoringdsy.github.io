<p>Numerous other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
