<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.

We likewise found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
