<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system.

Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
