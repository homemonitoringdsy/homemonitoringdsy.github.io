Now, most security systems involve a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few parts.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
