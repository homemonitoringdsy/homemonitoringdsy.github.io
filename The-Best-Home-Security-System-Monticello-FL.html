It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
